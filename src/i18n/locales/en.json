Before using the Dota website (\"Dota Casino\", \"Website\"), please read these Terms and Conditions carefully. By using this website you confirm your acceptance of these Terms and Conditions.<br/><br/>In the event of any discrepancy between the English and Spanish versions of these Terms and Conditions, the English version shall prevail.<br/><br/><br>Changes to the Terms and Conditions</br><br/>The Company may change these Terms and Conditions as necessary. The Company will make reasonable efforts to inform players of significant changes. Nevertheless, please review the Terms and Conditions regularly to stay informed of updates.<br/><br/><br>Who may play</br><br/>Dota Casino accepts players only from countries and geographic regions where online gambling is permitted by law. Players must independently verify the regulations and laws governing gambling in their country or region of residence. Responsibility for non-compliance with such laws rests entirely with the player.<br/><br/>Only persons aged 18 or over, or the minimum age required to participate in online gambling according to the laws of their place of residence, may play on the website. Responsibility for knowing such laws rests entirely with the player. If you are a player from Spain, the United Kingdom, the United States of America or any U.S. territory, you are prohibited from playing for real money on the website, including playing for Bitcoin.<br/><br/>The Company reserves the right to request evidence of the player's age compliance and to restrict access to play or suspend accounts for those who cannot provide evidence of reaching the required age for gambling.<br/><br/><br>Fees and taxes</br><br/>The player is solely responsible for paying any fees and taxes due on winnings in accordance with the laws of the player's country or region of residence.<br/><br/>If a player who requested withdrawal of funds from the website has not wagered an amount equal to at least three times the last deposit before making the withdrawal request, we reserve the right to charge that player the transaction processing costs for both the deposit and the withdrawal. This decision is at the discretion of Dota Casino management.<br/><br/><br>Game rules</br><br/>The player confirms that they know the rules of the games in which they may participate on the website. The responsibility for knowing payout percentages and rules for games the player participates in lies entirely with the player.<br/><br/><br>Disclaimer</br><br/>The player acknowledges that playing on the website may lead to monetary loss. The Company is not responsible for any financial losses incurred by the player as a result of playing on the website.<br/><br/>The Company takes all reasonable measures to protect the player's personal data and provides such data only to parties involved in delivering gaming services on the website. Nevertheless, the Company is not responsible for how third parties (for example, game providers or affiliates) handle this information. Processing of the player's personal data by such third parties is carried out in accordance with their terms and conditions.<br/><br/>The Company is not responsible for hardware or software defects, loss of internet connection, or any other technical problem that may limit a player's access to the website or interrupt their play.<br/><br/><br>Use of player account</br><br/>Each player is entitled to create a single gaming account. Creating more than one account for the same player may lead to deletion of all player accounts and cancellation of all cash payments. The player must not give anyone access to their gaming account nor allow third parties (including minors) to use the website from their account.<br/><br/>The website may only be used for personal purposes and must not be used for commercial purposes.<br/><br/><br>Anti-fraud</br><br/>The Company has a strict anti-fraud policy. If a player is suspected of fraudulent actions, including but not limited to:<br/>- colluding with other players,<br/>- developing strategies aimed at obtaining unfair gains,<br/>- fraudulent actions against other online casinos or payment systems,<br/>- chargebacks or reversals of credit card payments,<br/>- other types of fraud,<br/>- being declared bankrupt in the country of residence,<br/>- providing false information during registration,<br/>then the Company reserves the right to close all player accounts and cancel all cash payments. This decision is entirely at the Company’s discretion and the player will not be notified of the reasons for such decision. The Company reserves the right to notify relevant authorities to investigate fraudulent actions by the player.<br/><br/>The Company may require any player to provide documents confirming identity. The player may be asked to take a selfie holding the document and confirm the date the selfie was taken. Alteration of photographic documents using any special software is strictly prohibited. If the player does not provide requested documents within one month from the request, we reserve the right to confiscate the player's account balance and close the account.<br/><br/>If a player, for any reason, refuses to take a selfie in accordance with security requirements, they may request payment of funds to a bank account registered in their name.<br/><br/>We reserve the right to charge transaction processing costs to the player if they have not wagered the deposit amount at least three times before requesting withdrawals. Attempts to meet the 3× wagering requirement solely through table games (roulette, blackjack, poker, etc.) prior to requesting a withdrawal may be considered fraudulent actions against the payment system or the casino. This decision is entirely at the casino’s discretion and is not subject to appeal.<br/><br/><br>Deposit</br><br/>Dota Casino offers various methods to top up the gaming account. A player may use VISA and MasterCard credit and debit cards, as well as various online wallets to fund the account. Contact support at dotasoporte@gmail.com to inquire about the appropriate deposit method for your region of residence.<br/><br/>Also note that the minimum deposit is 5 EUR / 5 USD / 200 KZT.<br/><br/><br>Withdraw / Refund</br><br/>The minimum amount to withdraw funds is 20 EUR / 20 USD / 500 KZT. The maximum withdrawal amount depends on the payment system you use. If the requested withdrawal amount exceeds the payment system limit, the payment will be made in parts. Withdrawal requests begin processing immediately upon receipt; however, the withdrawal process may take up to five days with certain payment systems.<br/><br/>Each player may make up to two refunds in one day and up to seven in a calendar week. Cashouts that violate this restriction will be canceled, and the player will be notified by email. If a player’s withdrawal amount must be split into several payments to comply with payment system limits, such payments will be considered a single withdrawal provided the player has not made a deposit between them.<br/><br/>Dota Casino supports payments via Visa Original Credit Transfer (OCT) and Mastercard Payment Transfer. The card used at Dota Casino must not be a corporate credit card and must be issued in a country permitted by these rules.<br/><br/>Note that even if your country is among those allowed, we cannot guarantee a successful transaction because the card-issuing bank may block it at its discretion.<br/><br/>Also note that the operating currency of Dota Casino is the euro (EUR). If you transact in other currencies, the funds debited from your card may be slightly higher than the initial transaction amount due to currency conversion fees charged by the bank and/or payment system.<br/><br/>If the deposit was made with a credit or debit card and the withdrawal amount is equal to or less than the deposit amount, we reserve the right to return funds to that credit or debit card. If the withdrawal amount exceeds the deposit amount, the difference will be paid by one of the alternative payment methods.<br/><br/>The Company reserves the right to verify the player's identity before processing withdrawals and to delay payment for the time required for such verification. If the player provided inaccurate data, payment may be denied completely and the account disabled. If such a decision is made, the player will be notified by email.<br/><br/>If a player wins more than 50,000 EUR (or equivalent), we reserve the right to split the payment of the total amount into monthly payments of 50,000 EUR until all winnings are paid. The maximum payable amount to the player is 20,000 EUR per week and 50,000 EUR per month unless otherwise specified. Exceptions may be made for high VIP-status players. All progressive jackpots are paid in full.<br/><br/>E-wallet withdrawal times vary from a few seconds to 15 minutes. Withdrawals to credit/debit cards and by bank transfer may take 1–5 days. Account verification time prior to payment, if required, may be up to 12 hours.<br/><br/><br>BONUS TERMS</br><br/>1. All bonuses are available to players from all countries unless otherwise stated.<br/>2. Per address, IP address, email, phone number, payment system account (Neteller, Skrill, credit card, etc.), etc., bonuses may be received by only one person.<br/>3. When using any bonus code, only uppercase letters should be used. Each bonus code can be used only once.<br/>4. When playing with a bonus, real money will be spent first. Bets will be deducted from the player's real balance. If the real balance is exhausted, bets will be deducted from the bonus balance.<br/>5. Upon bonus expiration, the bonus and any winnings derived from it will be voided.<br/>6. Dota Casino reserves the right to update these rules at any time.<br/><br/><br>Privacy and security</br><br/><br/><br>1. Privacy</br><br/>All information about Dota Casino players is considered strictly confidential by the Company. All data is stored and processed in accordance with data protection and privacy laws.<br/><br/><br>2.
